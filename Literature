ACTUAL CONSUMPTION
Electricity consumed, average values for 15-minute intervals [MWh] – "Total" (grid load) is the net electricity generation minus export transmission capacity, plus import transmission capacity and minus the feed-in capacity from pumped storage power stations – data is provided with a delay of at most one hour [source: ENTSO-E]. "Residual load" is defined as the grid load minus the output from photovoltaic installations and wind power stations (onshore and offshore). "Pumped storage" corresponds to the feed-in capacity from pumped storage power stations, average values for 15-minute intervals [MWh].
It does not include the use of electrical energy from batteries, including rechargeable ones.

FORECASTED CONSUMPTION
Forecasted electricity consumption for the following day, figures presented as average values for 15 minute intervals [MWh]. The projection is based on the results of day-ahead trading and other empirical data - it is published no later than 2 hours before trading on the local electricity exchange closes (at 10 am) - figures are updated for every change of at least 10% [Source: ENTSO-E]. The forecasted residual load is defined as the forecasted electricity consumption minus the forecasted feed-in from photovoltaic installations and wind power stations (onshore and offshore).


ACTUAL GENERATION
Actual net electricity generation divided according to source of energy generation, presented as average values for 15 minute intervals [MWh] - in part, electricity generation is estimated where data is incomplete. For lack of real data, estimated figures may also be used for the feed in of small installations - data is delivered up to one hour after actual generation. [Source: ENTSO-E]
